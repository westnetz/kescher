kescher accounting tool
=======================

*kescher* is an accounting tool for small businesses. It has various helpers and interfaces
to be used with different bank statement formats, VAT tariffs and accounting philosophies. 

At westnetz we pay taxes on cash basis and are not required to create annual balances but
report our netincome to the tax office. Knowing that this use case is special, the tool currently
is optimized to do that. It might be possible to use *kescher* for other accounting methods, 
e.g. accrual basis, or without having to pay the VAT (small business operator regulations in 
Germany). But you should be aware, that errors and bugs in that case might not be covered by tests.
