**kescher** is a simple accounting tool. 

You can load in your bank statement, connect each booking
to a virtual account, load in invoices and attach documents
to each booking.

It is currently und heavy development and not recommended for
production use.

**kescher** is not a double accounting tool. If you need that,
have a look at (h)ledger or gnucash.
